# C.I.S.R - Command-line Interactive Scripts Runner

### Scissor the time spent revisiting your ton of scripts and commands with minimal effort.

This prompts the user for selecting flags, providing inputs to the scripts and commands. This saves a ton of time if the command is rarely used and needs to check the documentation. This helps to minimize that by asking flag-specific questions. In short, it can be used to document your script or a specific command with a lot of flags.

It can be used along with your existing commands without a need to modify them. All you need to do is create a JSON config file specifying the intention, input type, flags, and done!

## Why it was created?

I have shifted away from using managed servers because I have realized that it will save me a lot of money. But to manage a server, a lot of scripts and commands with a ton of arguments are needed. I found myself going back to the documentation and with time, it became harder to keep track of all the available scripts and commands in the server.

So, I created this to guide me ðŸ¦®. This helped me to keep track of all the scripts, commands, and flags (with default values) that are needed. It acts as interactive documentation for all my scripts and helped others to execute them without swearing _RTFM_.

#### You can use this in two ways

1. Command line binary
2. Using the framework to extend it with your code

## Installation

The package is the same for both command-line binary and framework. It's better to install it as a global package if you intend to use it as a command-line binary

### CommandLine Binary

```
npm install -g cisr
```

### Framework

```
npm install cisr
```

---

## How it works?

You create config files either in JSON or HJSON or JS and point the **CISR** to the directory which holds all your config files.

For most of the use-cases, JSON is enough to give the necessary information about how to run your scripts and commands to the **CISR**.

## Usage

### Command-line Binary

Running the `cisr` in the command line will start an interactive prompt. You can provide the location of your config files(JSON and js files).

#### To start

```
$ cisr
```

![First startup](https://i.imgur.com/o8OP6Wc.png)
In **Settings**, you can change the location to point it to the config files and also change the welcome message.

## Framework

CISR expects **Enquirer.js** objects to display the interactive prompt.
**How to use this framework** --

1. Extend the `CISRPrompt` abstract class, which is one of the named exports of this package.
2. Pass your constructed **Enquirer.js** array of objects to the `super()`
3. Implement the `runCommand()` abstract method. This method runs automatically as soon as the user answers all the questions. `this.answers` instance variable has all the answers. So, use this method to run commands, scripts, etc.
4. Keep repeating 1-3 steps for every category i.e., for every command or script you want to run. Every class represents a category that is used to run a specific task or script.
5. Run the function `await startRunner()` which is one of the named exports of this package to start the interactive prompt in a loop.

## Config Files

There are two ways you can provide the config files.

1. JS files
2. JSON/HJSON files

### JS Files

Refer to the above [Framework](#framework) section and `src/examples` folder to see how to write JS files. Or go to `src/lib/Prompt/JSONPrompts.ts` to see how `runCommand()` abstract method is implemented for reference.

### JSON/HJSON Files

**NOTE**: If you just want to include a flag without any value(for example like `-v` in `tar`), then use the `Confirm` type.

The above fields for the `prompts` key are required but not exhaustive. You can pass all the additional fields that an enquirer prompt can take. You can see all the available options that a certain type of prompt can take [here](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer#built-in-prompts)

### Example of HJSON file for using `tar` command

```javascript
// From: src/examples/tar.hjson

{
  "name": "Tar files",
  "command": {
    // executable name
    "file": "tar",
    "args": ["-cz"],
    "message": "Compressed the files",
    "appendFlagName": true
  },
  "prompts": [
    {
      // flag name
      "name": "-f",
      "type": "input",
      "message": "Archive Name?",
      // default value for the new archive
      "initial": "archive.tar.gz"
    },
    {
      "name": "-v",
      // confirm prompt. If true, -v flag is added
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Verbose?",
      "initial": true
    },
    {
      "name": "source",
      "type": "input",
      "message": "Source?",
      "initial": "/Users/skreweverything/.ssh",
      // Appending flag name on per flag basis.
      // As the source doesn't have any flag, `source` flag name is not appended
      "appendFlagName": false
    }
  ]
}

```

The order of prompts mentioned in the `prompts` array is the order of flags/args appended in the final command.

**NOTE**: Always provide an absolute path to a file or folder like in the example.

**TIP**: Try to use `hjson` files as it allows comments in the `json` for your future references.
